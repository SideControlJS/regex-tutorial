# Understanding Regex: Email Address Pattern Matching

In this tutorial, we delve into regular expressions (regex) by breaking down a commonly used pattern for validating email addresses. Regex offers a powerful way to search and manipulate text, and understanding its syntax is crucial for any web developer.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll explore the regex pattern used for matching email addresses: `^\w+([\.-]?\w+)*@\w+([\.-]?\w+)*(\.\w{2,3})+$`. This pattern makes sure a string matches the typical structure of an email address.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
- `^` asserts the start of a line.
- `$` asserts the end of a line


### Quantifiers
- `+` indicates one or more occurrences
- `{2,3}` specifies a minimum of 2 and a max of 3 occurrences.

### Grouping Constructs
- `(...)` groups multiple tokens together and remembers the matched text.

### Bracket Expressions
- `[\.-]` matches a single character provided in the list, either a dot or a hyphen.

### Character Classes
- `\w` matches any word character (equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]).

### The OR Operator
- Not explicitly used in this regex, but generally | is used to denote OR in regex.

### Character Escapes
- `\.` escapes the dot character to match it literally, as dots have special meaning in regex.
